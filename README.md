Done some testing stuffs and report issues.

[Stash](http://shenchao.im/2011/06/03/stash-coming-my-first-chrome-extensions/index.html)  
The extension doing the similar thing which I use before. But it seems that the extension will not get another update for new features. So I decide to design and implement a new one for my own requirement. 
Anyway, I want to say thanks to the devloper and his team [7Peers](http://www.7peers.com/). I learnt a lot from him.
